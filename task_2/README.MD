# Message truncator

The goal of this task is to implement module which can be used to truncate string attributes in any class, just by extending its functionality.

## Requirement
Given `Message` class extended by `Truncate` module and configured to truncate particular attribute in the following way `truncate :body, length: 120`. Complete `Truncate` module implementation.

## Rules
1. All work should be done in `truncate.rb` file
2. Ruby version doesn't matter
3. You can't use anything except Ruby standard library. No gems allowed

## Example usage
```ruby
body = "The fact that so many people make so much effort on the internet to make other random people from around the world laugh/feel better is a great achievement of the human race."
expected = "The fact that so many people make so much effort on the internet to make other random people from around the world laugh..."
expected == Message.new(body).body`
```
```bash
$ ruby task_1/test.rb
Given message body: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processed message: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna ali...
```
